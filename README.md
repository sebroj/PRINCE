# PRINCE
The Plasma Rocket Instability Characterizer (PRINCE) is a software tool capable
of conducting robust and customizable numerical characterizations of waves and
instabilities in plasma thrusters. It currently exists as a prototype,
implemented in the Wolfram Mathematica platform. This project will be a complete
translation, enhancement, and optimization of PRINCE, with all its core
procedures and mathematical algorithms written in native C++ code. This will
ensure that the new PRINCE is not only a coherent and accessible software tool,
but that it uses the available hardware intelligently to be as efficient as
possible across a wide range of platforms.

## Building PRINCE
You're on your own for now.
